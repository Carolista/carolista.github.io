    "desc": "I was originally accepted into a 7-year dual degree program to achieve both a Master of Architecture degree and a BS in Civil Engineering. However, after completing all the undergraduate architecture course requirements and starting on my graduate courses, I made the decision to focus solely on structural engineering. The education I received in both schools was top-notch, and I am grateful to have had the opportunity to learn so much in just 5 years.",
