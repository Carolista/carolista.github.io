My favorite thing was making pictures out of characters, line by line, and then seeing them come off of the dot matrix printer. In a way, I think this was my first introduction to coding concepts."

I still have my console hooked up to my TV, and from time to time I pull out Super Mario Bros., the Legend of Zelda, Tetris, Ultima, or others for a good dose of nostalgia. I think it was during this period that I really became fascinated with the idea about how these programs were created even though I didn't know what code looked like yet."

I learned HTML (such as it was), checked my e-mail in PINE using Telnet, and occasionally took breaks to play Acrophobia on IRC. A class on numerical methods introduced me to FORTRAN and MATLAB, a drafting class covered AutoCAD, and in the architecture school I was introduced to rendering programs like Form-Z."

I started studying a few things on the side, like Python, but things really took off when I was accepted into LaunchCode's LC101 program and learned multiple languages, tools, and platforms in a short amount of time. I was voracious, using sites like HackerRank and CodeWars to solve hundreds of practice problems."
