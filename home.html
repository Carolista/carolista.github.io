                        <p>Officially my name is Caroline, but most people call me Carrie. I am a web developer and software engineer with rapidly-expanding skills in multiple languages and frameworks, building on a wide range of past experience &mdash; including graphic design, technical writing, copy writing, and database customization. I thrive on learning new and better ways to accomplish things. I am also passionate about mentoring and teaching others, and take great joy in my students at <a href="https://www.launchcode.org" target="_blank">LaunchCode</a>.</p>
                        <p>While my fort√© is front end development, I am capable of jumping in on full stack and back end projects as well. I'm a natural leader and organizer with strong communication skills, so I enjoy many aspects of project management. In addition to versatility, my strengths include attention to detail, reliability, and a continual pursuit of personal & professional growth. </p>

                        <p class="content-subheader">A Lifelong Love Affair with Computers</p>
                        <p>My journey into tech has been almost entirely non-traditional, and a long time coming. From my earliest days learning DOS on a Tandy, to a couple of required CS classes in college, then 20 years in the nonprofit sector working with whatever cobbled-together technology I had available to me, I have generally been the person that everyone comes to for help with their computers, whether it was my job or not. (It wasn't, but I am always happy to help!)</p>
                        <p>It took a battle with cancer in 2017 to wake me up to the realization that I wanted to do whatever it took to switch to a career in tech. Enter <a href="https://www.launchcode.org" target="_blank">LaunchCode</a> &mdash; and the many wonderful people who taught me, mentored me, and encouraged me along the way &mdash; and I have achieved my dream! As a web developer, software engineer, and mentor to students, I love that I am constantly learning new things, and I am looking forward to continuing this journey ahead of me.</p>
