                  <p>Hi there! My name is Caroline, but most people call me Carrie. I am a software engineer with rapidly-expanding skills in multiple languages and frameworks. I thrive on learning new and better ways to accomplish things. I am also passionate about mentoring and teaching others, and take great joy in my students at <a href="https://www.launchcode.org" target="_blank">LaunchCode</a>.</p>
                  <p>My fort√© is front end development and I love wiring up the code behind-the-scenes to create a seamless, enjoyable user experience. I'm a natural leader and organizer with strong communication skills, and I work well with others as a team. In addition to versatility, my strengths include attention to detail, reliability, and a continual pursuit of personal & professional growth.</p>

                  <p class="content-header">A Lifelong Love Affair with Computers</p>
                  <p>My journey into tech has been almost entirely non-traditional, and a long time coming. From my earliest days learning DOS on a Tandy, to a couple of required CS classes in college, then 20 years in the nonprofit sector working with whatever cobbled-together technology I had available to me &mdash; I have always enjoyed computers and been more than comfortable learning new things on my own.</p>
                  <p>It took a battle with cancer in 2017 to wake me up to the realization that I wanted to do whatever it took to formally switch to a career in tech. Enter <a href="https://www.launchcode.org" target="_blank">LaunchCode</a> &mdash; and the many wonderful people who taught me, mentored me, and encouraged me along the way &mdash; and I had a strong start in my new career. As both software engineer and instructor, I love that I am constantly learning new things, and I am looking forward to continuing this journey ahead of me.</p>
